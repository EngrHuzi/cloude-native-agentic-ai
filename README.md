🚀 AI-400: Cloud-Native AI Engineering
Docker • Kubernetes • Dapr • AI-Driven Development (AIDD)

Based on Panaversity Flagship Program – AI-400
Cloud-Native Infrastructure for Intelligent AI Systems

📌 Overview

This repository contains my learning journey, projects, and implementations for the AI-400: Cloud-Native AI course by Panaversity.

The course focuses on building scalable, production-ready AI systems using cloud-native technologies and AI-Driven Development (AIDD). Instead of manually writing infrastructure code, we use Specification-Driven Development (SDD) — where AI helps generate Docker, Kubernetes, and Dapr configurations from high-level specifications.

🎯 Objectives

By completing this repository, I aim to:

Build cloud-agnostic AI systems

Containerize AI applications using Docker

Orchestrate intelligent services with Kubernetes

Use Dapr for service communication, state management, and pub/sub

Apply AI-Driven Development (AIDD) and Context Engineering

Deploy production-ready AI agent systems

🧠 Prerequisites

Recommended before starting AI-400:

✅ AI-300: AI-Driven Development with Python

✅ Basic Python & FastAPI knowledge

✅ Fundamental understanding of cloud concepts
